            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Matias Kerttula. I am from Finland, and I live in Oulu. I am 23 years old.
            I am currently in my second year, working towards a Bachelor of Engineering degree
            in Information Technology at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.    
            During my freetime I like to play videogames, be with my friends, humour my fiance and sometimes
            I might even be spotted outside touching some grass. I'm eager to learn more about everything IT. 
            Before I started studying, I worked in security for POKO Oy. After almost 4 years as a guard, 
            I decided to start studying again. Below is a link for my GitHub page.</p>
